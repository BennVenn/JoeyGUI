JoeyGUI uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License v. 3 and the GNU Lesser General Public License v. 2.1 (both jointly "LGPL"). In compliance with LGPL, this document collects the relevant information about downloading, installing, and building the Qt Toolkit from sources. The main source of the information and most of the web links provided here come from the Qt Company's website (http://www.qt.io/)
LGPL License Text
The first step in compliance with LGPL is that every recipient of the JoeyGUI software receives also the full text of the LGPL licenses used. JoeyGUI complies with this requirement by including the full text of the LGPL licenses (lgpl-2.1.txt and lgpl-3.txt) in every JoeyGUI distribution. The full text of the LGPL licenses can be found in both the release folder and root source folder.
On each supported platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS), JoeyGUI dynamically links to the unmodified Qt libraries, as provided by the Qt Company in the pre-compiled binary format.
Also, in compliance with LGPL, the "About QT" dialog box of the JoeyGUI application prominently states that this program uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL.
Qt Version Information
Additionally, the JoeyGUI 'About Qt' Menu includes the standard "About Qt" dialog box, which informs the user about the exact version of Qt and explains the Qt licensing terms. Finally, the QM Manual prominently states that this program uses the Qt Toolkit under the terms of LGPL.
